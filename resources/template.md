My study plan for going from junior to senior software developer (i. e. from level 1 to level 3 of the
[Programmer Competency Matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix)). Inspired by
[Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university).

## Usage

```bash
# install rust toolchain
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KolesnichenkoDS/from-junior-to-senior
cd from-junior-to-senior

# edit the list
vim resources/todo.json

# render to markdown
cargo run -- resources/ -f json -F markdown -o README.md
```

If you want to suggest a resource, you can just [open an issue](https://github.com/KolesnichenkoDS/from-junior-to-senior/issues).
